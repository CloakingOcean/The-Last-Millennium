# The-Last-Millennium
Abandoned website created to showcase our gaming group's members and videos.

# Purpose
This is an old project I was working on. This website would be the go-to spot to get information about events, members, and videos from the group.

# Main Features
One of the main features I was working on with this website was creating HTML code using JavaScript. For example, the members page is all populated by a javascript file that uses a list of information for all the members.
